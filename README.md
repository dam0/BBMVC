BBMVC
=====

BareBones MVC is a very simple MVC framework written in Haxe. The goal is to develope it in a way where it can be used cross platform with all the languages Haxe supports.

The framework is built with the understanding that you will be registering views with a data model that extends org.bbmvc.models.BBModel. 
This will allow your data model to call update on your IBBView.
